Bisque:

Amount    | Ingredient
--------- | ----------------------
2 tbsp.   | Unsalted Butter
1 cup     | Yellow Onions, chopped
1/2 cup   | Carrots, chopped
1/2 cup   | Celery, chopped
1/2 tsp.  | Salt
1/2 tsp.  | Cayenne
1/2 tsp.  | Garlic, chopped
2 tbsp.   | Tomato Paste
1/2 cup   | Cognac or Brandy

1/2 tsp.  | Fresh Thyme, chopped
1/2 lb.   | Shrimp reserved from stock recipe
3/4 cup   | Heavy Cream
2 tsp.    | Lemon Juice

Directions
----------

To make the stock, in a large heavy pot, melt 2 tbsp. of butter over medium high heat.  Add the onions, carrots, celery, garlic, bay leaves, salt and peppercorns and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the shrimp shells and cook, stirring, until golden about 3 minutes.  Add the wine and bring to boil, cooking until almost all evaporated.  Add the water and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes, skimming to remove any foam that forms on the surface.  Remove from the heat and strain through a fine mesh strainer into a clean container, pressing on the shells to extract as much liquid as possible.  Discard the shells.

In a clean large pot, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the onions, carrots, celery, salt and cayenne, and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the garlic, tomato paste and cook until starting to brown, about 2 minutes.

Add the cognac and cook until almost evaporated.  Add shrimp stock, tarragon and thyme and simmer for 20 minutes.

Remove from the heat and puree with a hand-held immersion blender or in batches in a blender or food processor.

Return to the heat and add the shrimp, cream and lemon juice.  Simmer gently until the shrimp are cooked through and the flavors marry, about 5 minutes.  Adjust seasoning to taste.

Tips
----

1.  Replace the shrimp with small lobster tails removing and rough chopping the meat.
2.  Pour the lemon juice over the shrimp or lobster while the stock is cooking.  It infuses the seafood with a burst of lemon.
3.  Double the shrimp or lobster.  Add half before blending for more texture and flavor.
4.  Serve with fresh italian or french bread for dipping.
