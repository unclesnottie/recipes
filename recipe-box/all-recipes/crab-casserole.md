Amount   | Ingredient
-------- | ---------------------
1 lb.    | Imitation Crab Meat
1 cup    | Swiss Cheese (grated)
1/4 cup  | Butter
1/4 cup  | Flour
1 cup    | Milk
1 cup    | Light Cream
1/8 tsp. | Dry Mustard
3 shakes | Worcestershire Sauce

Directions
----------

Layer casserole dish with alternating layers of crab meat & cheese finishing with a layer of cheese.  Melt the butter and mix with the flour, milk, cream, dry mustard and worcestershire sauce.  Pour mixture over casserole.  Heat at 350° until cheese is melted and crab is hot (about 30 min.).

Tips
----

1.  Use 1.5 lb of crab meat.
2.  Use 2 cups of swiss (about one 10oz. Block, grated).
3.  If your casserole dish is deep (deeper than about 1 1/2 inches), it will need to cook for about 45min.
4.  You may need to make an extra half recipe of the butter, flour, milk, cream, mustard and worcestershire mixture. Make enough to cover the crab meat completely.
5.  Add a couple thin pats of butter to the top for a nice golden brown top.
